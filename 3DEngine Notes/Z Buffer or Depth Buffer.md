- Our Z buffer will basically parallel our frame buffer in size, but instead of colors, we will be storing float values.
- At first, the problem seems simple.
	- If we know the Z coordinates of the triangle's vertices, we can interpolate these using the barycentric coordinates
- Sadly, this doesn't work, and its thanks to our projection.
- Because of perspective divide, the z-value we want to interpolate no longer varies linearly across the surface of the 2D triangle.
- Recall, perspective projection preserves lines but does not preserve distances.
- The Z-buffer was proposed by Ed Catmull in his 1974 paper, "A Subdivision Algorithm for Computer Display of Curved Surfaces"
