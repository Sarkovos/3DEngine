## Algorithm overview:
- Define a triangle
- Surround the triangle into a bounding box defined by the maxes of the vertices
- Loop all pixels in the bounding box

#### Cross Product
- To tell if a point is inside our triangle, if we say our triangles are defined *clockwise*, then for each edge of the triangle, the point has to exist to the right of that edge, and this must hold for each edge.
- To find this, we can use the cross product
- The cross product takes two *3D* vectors, $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, and generates a new vector perpendicular to the two starting vectors
- The magnitude of this vector is equal to the size of the parallelogram generated by the addition of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, sort of like the determinant
- magnitude of the cross product is $||\vec{a}||||\vec{b}||\sin\theta$
- Cross product is not commutative
- We will use if the cross product is either positive or negative to determine where the point lies
- Technically cross product is only defined in 3 and 7 dimensions (don't ask) but we can just think of a 2D cross product as the length of the z component of the the imaginary vector perpendicular to the screen plane
- This is much more like the determinant
- So,
	- $cross(v_1, v_2, p) \leq 0$
	- $cross(v_0, v_1, p) \leq 0$
	- $cross(v_2, v_0, p) \leq 0$
	- If these are all true, point $p$ is in the triangle

#### Fill Convention
- Top-Left Rule: A pixel center is defined to lie inside of a triangle if it lies on a flat top edge or a left edge of a triangle
- In a counter-clockwise triangle, a top edge is an edge that is exactly horizontal and goes towards the left, i.e. its end point is left of its start point.
- In a counter-clockwise triangle, a left edge is an edge that goes down, i.e. its end point is strictly below its start point.
- If our sample point actually falls inside the triangle (not on an edge), we draw it no matter what. It if happens to fall on an edge, we draw it if and only if that edge happens to be a top or a left edge.
- To implement this, we add a test to check for the rule. If it passes, the pixel is drawn as is. If it fails, we use a bias variable to shift this value of the cross product for that edge by -1. This way, if that point is directly on the edge of the triangle, and fails the top-left test, it will not be drawn

#### Barycentric Coordinates
- $p = (\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$
- $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1.0$
- $p = \alpha v_0 + \beta v_1 + \gamma v_2$
